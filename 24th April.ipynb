    "### => In the context of data analysis and dimensionality reduction, a projection refers to the process of transforming data from a high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space while preserving the most important information. In essence, it is the act of \"projecting\" data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace. Projections are used in various dimensionality reduction techniques, and one prominent method that heavily relies on projections is Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n",
    "\n",
    "### => PCA is a widely used linear dimensionality reduction technique that aims to find the most significant directions (principal components) along which the data varies the most. These principal components are orthogonal (uncorrelated) to each other, and they form a new basis for the data. The first principal component explains the most variance, the second explains the second most variance, and so on.\n",

    "## 1) Compute the Mean: \n",
    "### => Calculate the mean of each feature across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Center the Data:\n",
