For example, in a variable representing education level, we might assign 1 to \"High School\", 2 to \"Associate's Degree\", 3 to \"Bachelor's Degree\", and so on. Ordinal encoding assumes that there is some order or ranking among the categories, and encodes them accordingly.\n",

    "### => Label Encoding, on the other hand, assigns a unique numerical value to each category without any particular order or hierarchy. For example, in a variable representing fruit types, we might assign 1 to \"Apple\", 2 to \"Banana\", 3 to \"Orange\", and so on. Label encoding is useful when there is no natural order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "### \n",

For instance, if you are building a model to predict customer satisfaction ratings on a scale from \"Very Dissatisfied\" to \"Very Satisfied\", it would make sense to use Ordinal Encoding as there is a clear order among the ratings.\n",
