    "### => In Flask, app routes are used to create the basic structure of a web application. They provide a way to define the various pages or views of the application and the URLs that correspond to them. By defining routes, Flask can route incoming requests to the appropriate view or function, which can then generate a response to send back to the client.\n",
    "### => App routes also allow Flask applications to have a RESTful architecture, which is a style of software architecture that uses a set of standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to manipulate resources. Each route can be associated with a specific HTTP method, allowing the application to respond to requests in a standardized and predictable way.\n",
