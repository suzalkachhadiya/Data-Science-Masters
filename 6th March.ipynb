If the company asks customers to rate their experience on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is \"Very dissatisfied\" and 5 is \"Very satisfied,\" the data are ordinal because the difference between the rating of 1 and 2 may not be the same as the difference between 4 and 5. If the company asks customers to rate their experience on a scale from 0 to 100, the data are interval because the difference between 10 and 20 is the same as the difference between 70 and 80, but there is no true zero point. Finally, if the company asks customers to rate the percentage of their satisfaction, the data are ratio because there is a true zero point, and the difference between 50% and 60% is the same as the difference between 90% and 100%\n"
