It penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones, making it suitable when you want to emphasize accurate predictions while accounting for the magnitude of errors.\n",

    "## 2) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
    "### => RMSE is the square root of the mean squared error and represents the average magnitude of errors in the same unit as the target variable (house price). It is commonly used when you want to assess the average prediction error and want the metric to be interpretable in the original scale of the target variable.\n",

    "## 3) Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "### => MAE calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual house prices. It provides a measure of the average magnitude of errors without considering their direction. MAE is useful when you want a metric that is more robust to outliers or when the direction of errors is less important.\n",

R-squared is valuable when you want to assess the goodness of fit of the model and understand the percentage of variability in house prices that can be accounted for by the model."
