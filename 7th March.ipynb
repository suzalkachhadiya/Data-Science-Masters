The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is a more commonly used measure than variance because it has the same unit of measure as the original data, making it more interpretable. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the values are closely clustered around the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates that the values are more widely spread out from the mean."
