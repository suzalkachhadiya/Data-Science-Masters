    "### => Time-dependent seasonal components refer to seasonal patterns in a time series that change over time rather than being stable\n",
    "## 1) Magnitude of seasonality changes over time \n",
    "### => The amplitude of seasonal fluctuations increases or decreases from one year to the next. For example, the peak holiday sales in December may be higher this year compared to previous years.\n",
    "## 2) Seasonal pattern shifts over time \n",
    "### => The timing of seasonal peaks and troughs changes. For example, the lowest sales level during summer used to be in June but is now in July.\n",
    "## 3) Appearance and disappearance of seasonality \n",
    "### => A time series exhibits seasonality in certain time periods but not in other periods. For example, a new product may not have yearly seasonality initially but develops seasonal fluctuations in demand after a few years.\n",
    "## 4) Changes in seasonal duration \n",
    "### => The span of seasonal periods changes. For example, holiday demand extends over more weeks but the Thanksgiving week peak has shortened.\n",
    "## 5) Interactions with trends \n",
    "### => Upward or downward trends combine with seasonality causing changing seasonal effects."
