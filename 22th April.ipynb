    "### How this difference affects the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Sensitivity to Data Scaling:\n",
    "### => Euclidean distance considers the actual geometric distances between data points, while Manhattan distance only considers the distances along the axes. As a result, Euclidean distance is more sensitive to the scale of the features. If some features have a larger magnitude compared to others, they will disproportionately influence the Euclidean distance, potentially leading to inaccurate results. On the other hand, Manhattan distance is less affected by feature scaling since it only considers the absolute differences between coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Decision Boundary Shape:\n",
    "### => The choice of distance metric affects the shape of the decision boundary in a KNN classifier. Euclidean distance tends to create circular decision boundaries, while Manhattan distance tends to create square-shaped decision boundaries aligned with the coordinate axes. The optimal choice depends on the underlying data distribution. For example, if the true decision boundary is closer to a circle-like shape, Euclidean distance might be more appropriate, but if it aligns better with axis-aligned squares or rectangles, Manhattan distance could be better suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) Curse of Dimensionality:\n",
    "### => In high-dimensional spaces, the curse of dimensionality can become an issue for KNN. Since Euclidean distance considers all dimensions, it may suffer from increased computational complexity and sparsity of data points, leading to reduced performance. In contrast, Manhattan distance, which considers the distances along each individual axis, can be less impacted by the curse of dimensionality.\n",
