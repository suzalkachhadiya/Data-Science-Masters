When a client makes a GET request, it sends a request to the server for a specific resource (like a web page or an image), and the server responds by sending the requested resource back to the client. GET requests are considered to be \"safe\" and \"idempotent,\" which means that they don't change anything on the server, and making the same request multiple times will have the same result.\n",
    "### => For example, if you type a URL into your web browser and hit enter, your browser will send a GET request to the server hosting that URL to retrieve the web page associated with that URL.\n",
    "### \n",
    "### => The POST method is used to send data to the server. When a client makes a POST request, it sends data (like form data or JSON data) to the server for processing. The server then processes the data and responds with a result. POST requests are considered to be \"unsafe\" and \"not idempotent,\" which means that they can change things on the server, and making the same request multiple times may have different results.\n",
    "### => For example, when you fill out a web form and click \"submit,\" your browser sends a POST request to the server with the form data you entered, and the server processes the data (like saving it to a database) and responds with a confirmation message.\n",
