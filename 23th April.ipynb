The goal of feature selection is to retain the most informative and discriminative features while discarding irrelevant or redundant ones. This process is essential for improving model performance, reducing overfitting, and addressing the curse of dimensionality.\n",

    "## 1) Filter methods: These methods assess the relevance of each feature individually and independently of the machine learning algorithm used. They rank features based on some statistical measure, such as correlation, mutual information, chi-square, or the Fisher score. Features with higher rankings are considered more informative and are selected for the final model.\n",

They create subsets of features, evaluate each subset by training and testing the model, and select the subset that yields the best performance. Wrapper methods can be computationally expensive since they involve multiple model training processes, but they are more effective in selecting the most relevant features.\n",

    "## 2) Reduced overfitting: \n",
    "### => When the number of features is large compared to the number of data points, there is a higher risk of overfitting, where the model captures noise or irrelevant patterns from the training data. Feature selection helps reduce the number of dimensions, which in turn mitigates overfitting and makes the model more robust.\n",

As the number of dimensions (features) increases relative to the number of data points, the risk of overfitting also increases.\n",
    "### => Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too complex and captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data, rather than learning meaningful patterns that generalize to new, unseen data. High-dimensional data exacerbates this problem because the model has more degrees of freedom to fit the noise and intricacies of the training data, leading to poor generalization.\n",

It involves plotting a metric (e.g., reconstruction error, explained variance, or the objective function of the method) against the number of dimensions. The optimal number of dimensions is typically located at the \"elbow\" point, where the curve starts to flatten, indicating diminishing returns in terms of the metric's improvement.\n",

In the context of dimensionality reduction, you can use cross-validation to assess the impact of different numbers of dimensions on the performance of the downstream machine learning model. For example, you can use k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance with different numbers of retained dimensions and select the one that provides the best trade-off between model complexity and performance.\n",
