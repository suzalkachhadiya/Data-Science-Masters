    "### => Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that involves using sample data to make inferences or draw conclusions about population parameters. In other words, estimation statistics involves using a sample to estimate an unknown characteristic of a population.\n",
    "### \n",
    "## 1) Point Estimate:\n",
    "### => A point estimate is a single numerical value that is used to estimate an unknown population parameter. This value is usually derived from sample data and provides an estimate of the true value of the population parameter. \n",
    "### => For example, if we wanted to estimate the average height of all college students in the India, we could take a random sample of college students and calculate the average height of the sample. This calculated average would be our point estimate of the true population average height.\n",
    "## 2) Interval Estimate:\n",
    "### => An interval estimate is a range of values within which we believe the true population parameter lies. This range is usually based on sample data and includes a margin of error. Interval estimates are useful when we need to be more precise and accurate in our estimations.\n",
    "### => For example, if we wanted to estimate the average height of all college students in the India with 95% confidence, we could take a random sample of college students and calculate the average height of the sample, along with a margin of error. This margin of error would allow us to construct an interval estimate, such as \"the true population average height is between 68 and 72 inches, with 95% confidence.\""
