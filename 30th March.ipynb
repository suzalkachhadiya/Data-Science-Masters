    "### => Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the penalties of two popular regularization methods: L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regression. The Elastic Net penalty function includes a mixture of both the L1 and L2 penalties and provides a compromise between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "### => In traditional linear regression, the goal is to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. However, in some cases, this can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and starts to perform poorly on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### => Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regression can help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### => Elastic Net Regression combines the benefits of both L1 and L2 regularization by including a mixture of both penalty terms in the cost function. This allows it to handle situations where there are many features that may be correlated with each other and some of them may be irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### => Compared to other regression techniques like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Ridge regression, and Lasso regression, Elastic Net Regression can be more effective in handling datasets with high-dimensional features and strong multicollinearity among the features. It also tends to perform better when there are a large number of features and many of them are irrelevant or only weakly correlated with the target variable. However, Elastic Net Regression can be computationally expensive and requires tuning of the regularization hyperparameters to optimize its performance."
