    "### => Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that is used to deal with the problem of multicollinearity in regression models. In multicollinearity, the independent variables of a regression model are highly correlated with each other, making it difficult to estimate the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### => Ridge regression adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression objective function, which helps to reduce the impact of multicollinearity on the regression coefficients. The penalty term is a function of the squared values of the regression coefficients, multiplied by a tuning parameter lambda. By adjusting lambda, the degree of shrinkage of the regression coefficients towards zero can be controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### => In contrast to ordinary least squares regression, which aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the predicted values and actual values, ridge regression minimizes the sum of squared residuals plus the penalty term. The penalty term helps to prevent overfitting and improves the generalization performance of the model."
